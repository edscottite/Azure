# Security Concerns
Azure is purely a non-for-profit application in the style of a Terminal ( For now ) on which allows easy access to system wide control. 

I'm aware that concerns may be held in regards to the "lg" feature. It's not "surfing", or actively monitering. It's purely time-based ( Not looped ) and is preferably only to be used for 1 minute  / 30 seconds ( For now - Real-time and infinite/linear progression is not available to the public right now. It merely oversees the network traffic through a data model represented by the quraries per 500 miliseconds ( To give it the "real-time" act ).
